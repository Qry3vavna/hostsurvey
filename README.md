HostSurvey
==========
 <pre>
</pre>
  A host survey script for Unix systems, though tested on Linux
  Used to identify all sorts of things on a box with the help of
  GNU core utilities like grep, sed, cat, tr & others.
  Ran locally on a system, optionally select a subset of commands.
  Can also print out the commands for other systems vs running them.
